## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Set up new schema alongside localStorage
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate existing user data
3. **Phase 3**: Remove localStorage dependencies
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize database performance

### AI Integration Approach
```javascript
// Enhanced AI service structure
class AIService {
  async generateContent(tool: string, inputs: any, language: 'en' | 'bn') {
    const prompt = this.buildPrompt(tool, inputs, language);
    const response = await this.callAI(prompt);
    return this.parseStructuredResponse(response, tool);
  }

  private buildPrompt(tool: string, inputs: any, language: string) {
    // Tool-specific prompt engineering
    // Bengali context integration
    // Framework-specific templates
  }
}
```
