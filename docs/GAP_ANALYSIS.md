- **Responsive UI**: VentureKit-inspired design with hover sidebar
- **Basic Onboarding**: 5-step process with localStorage persistence
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **File Handling**: PDF generation and basic file utilities
- **Component Library**: Well-structured with Shadcn/ui

### ✅ User Experience
- **Professional Design**: Clean, modern interface
- **Smooth Navigation**: Hover-based sidebar with company switcher
- **Onboarding Flow**: Guided setup process
- **Mobile Responsive**: Desktop-first but mobile compatible

## Critical Gaps Identified

### ❌ Core Product Vision Misalignment

#### 1. **Tool Architecture Gap**
**Current**: Single "generate-document" page with basic templates
**Required**: 18+ distinct tools across Strategy & Execution modules
- Strategy & Branding Lab: 8 specialized frameworks
- Execution & Growth Cockpit: 10 tactical tools
- Content Creation Engine: 4 content types with guided workflows

#### 2. **Content Generation Sophistication Gap**
**Current**: Basic document generation with simple templates
**Required**: Tool-specific AI workflows with:
- Dynamic form builders per tool
- Step-by-step guided processes (Idea → Hook → Body → CTA → Caption)
- Bengali language support with cultural context
- Framework-specific prompt engineering

#### 3. **Business Context Integration Gap**
**Current**: Basic business info collection
**Required**: Comprehensive business intelligence:
- 500-word AI-generated business overview
- Multi-file knowledge base (4 PDFs ≤30 pages each)
- Historical ads performance data (CSV import)
- Mentor approval workflow

### ❌ Backend Infrastructure Gaps

#### 1. **Data Persistence Gap**
**Current**: localStorage only (client-side)
**Required**: Full database architecture:
- User management and authentication
- Organization/team management (Pro plan)
- Business profiles and knowledge base storage
- Content versioning and template system
- Performance analytics storage

#### 2. **Authentication & Authorization Gap**
**Current**: No authentication system
**Required**: Comprehensive auth system:
- User registration and login
- Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Contributor, Viewer)
- Team workspace management
- Plan-based feature gating (Standard vs Pro)

#### 3. **File Processing Pipeline Gap**
**Current**: Basic file upload with client-side handling
**Required**: Robust server-side processing:
- PDF parsing and content extraction
- CSV data validation and import
- File storage and management
- Background job processing

### ❌ AI Integration Enhancement Needs

#### 1. **Multi-Provider Architecture Gap**
**Current**: Single OpenRouter integration
**Required**: Flexible AI architecture:
- OpenAI API direct integration
- Multiple provider fallbacks
- Usage tracking and quota management
- Provider-specific optimization

#### 2. **Bengali Language Support Gap**
**Current**: English-only interface and content
**Required**: Full Bengali localization:
- UI language switching
- Bengali content generation
- Cultural context in AI responses
- Framework terminology in Bengali

#### 3. **Structured Content Generation Gap**
**Current**: Simple text generation
**Required**: Complex structured outputs:
- Multi-section documents with headers
- Table and list formatting
- Template-based content generation
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

## Technical Debt and Quality Gaps

### Code Organization
- **Current**: Monolithic page components
- **Required**: Modular tool architecture with reusable components

### Error Handling
- **Current**: Basic try-catch blocks
- **Required**: Comprehensive error boundaries, user feedback, and recovery

### Performance
- **Current**: Client-side processing only
- **Required**: Background jobs, caching, and optimization

### Testing
- **Current**: No automated testing
- **Required**: Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)

## Business Logic Gaps

### 1. **Framework Integration Gap**
**Current**: Generic templates
**Required**: Specific business frameworks:
- iMarketing methodologies
- GrowthX strategies  
- iMBA advanced concepts
- Proprietary blueprint generation

### 2. **Analytics and Learning Gap**
**Current**: No performance tracking
**Required**: Comprehensive analytics:
- Content performance measurement
- Template success analysis  
- User behavior insights
- ROI calculation and reporting

### 3. **Collaboration Features Gap**
**Current**: Single-user experience
**Required**: Team collaboration (Pro plan):
- Shared workspaces
- Real-time collaboration
- Template sharing
- Activity logging and permissions

## Prioritized Action Plan

### Phase 1 (Immediate - 4 weeks)
1. **Database Implementation**: Set up PostgreSQL with core schema
2. **Authentication System**: Implement NextAuth.js with role-based access
3. **Enhanced Onboarding**: Align with iDEAN AI requirements
4. **AI Service Enhancement**: Add OpenAI direct integration

### Phase 2 (Short-term - 8 weeks)
1. **Tool Architecture**: Implement dynamic tool system
2. **Strategy Lab Tools**: Build first 4 strategy frameworks
3. **Content Generation**: Enhanced AI workflows with Bengali support
4. **File Processing**: Robust PDF and CSV handling

### Phase 3 (Medium-term - 12 weeks)
1. **Execution Tools**: Complete Growth Cockpit implementation
2. **Team Features**: Pro plan collaboration features
3. **Analytics Hub**: Performance tracking and insights
4. **Template System**: Advanced template management

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
- **AI Integration Complexity**: Multiple providers, fallbacks, Bengali support
- **Database Migration**: Moving from localStorage to full database
- **User Experience Continuity**: Maintaining usability during transformation

### Medium-Risk Areas
- **Performance Impact**: Background processing and file handling
- **Bengali Localization**: Cultural context and language accuracy
