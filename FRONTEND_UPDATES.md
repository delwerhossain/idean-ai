# Frontend Updates Summary

## 🎯 Task Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All frontend issues have been resolved to integrate properly with the backend APIs.

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. API Client Updates (`src/lib/api/client.ts`)
- ✅ Added missing imports: `getCurrentFirebaseUser`, `getStoredUser`
- ✅ Enhanced multipart/form-data support for file uploads
- ✅ Added proper content-type handling for FormData requests
- ✅ Updated file upload to use correct field names (`documents` for business documents)

### 2. Business API Integration (`src/lib/api/idean-api.ts`)
- ✅ Updated document upload API to use `/businesses/{id}/documents` endpoint
- ✅ Added `createWithDocument` method for business creation with PDF upload
- ✅ Implemented proper multipart/form-data handling
- ✅ Added document search functionality
- ✅ Updated API responses to match backend Swagger documentation

### 3. BusinessContextStep Component (`src/components/onboarding/BusinessContextStep.tsx`)
- ✅ **REMOVED localStorage dependency** - now uses real API calls
- ✅ Implemented PDF upload with 3MB validation (as per requirement)
- ✅ Added proper error handling and progress tracking
- ✅ Integrated with business document upload API
- ✅ Auto-save functionality for business context and mentor approval

### 4. AuthContext Updates (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ **Enhanced JWT handling** - now properly processes backend JWT tokens
- ✅ Added logging for enhanced JWT payload (userId, email, role, businessId)
- ✅ Updated business creation to refresh JWT with new businessId and role
- ✅ Improved error handling for authentication flow

### 5. User Interface Updates (`src/lib/api.ts`)
- ✅ Added `businessId` field to User interface to match backend JWT structure

### 6. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created `.env.local` with correct API URL (port 8001)
- ✅ Added Firebase configuration placeholders
- ✅ Set proper API timeout configuration

## 🔄 API Integration Details

### Business Document Upload Flow:
1. **Validation**: Client validates PDF file (3MB max, PDF only)
2. **Upload**: Uses `POST /businesses/{businessId}/documents` with multipart/form-data
3. **Processing**: Backend processes PDF and stores in vector database (Qdrant)
4. **Response**: Returns document metadata and upload confirmation

### Enhanced JWT Token Structure:
```javascript
{
  userId: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name,
  photoURL: user.photoURL || null,
  businessId: user.businessId || null,    // 🆕 Enhanced
  role: user.role || 'user'              // 🆕 Enhanced
}
```

### Business Context Management:
- **Auto-save**: Debounced API calls to update business context (800ms delay)
- **Real-time**: No localStorage - all data synced with backend
- **Validation**: 3MB PDF limit enforced on client and server

## 🔐 Authentication Flow
1. Firebase authentication → ID token
2. Backend verification → Enhanced JWT token
3. JWT stored in localStorage for API calls
4. Token includes businessId and role for proper authorization

## 📁 File Upload Specifications
- **Format**: PDF only (`application/pdf`)
- **Size**: Maximum 3MB (enforced client + server)
- **Quantity**: 1 file only (as per requirement)
- **Processing**: Automatic text extraction and vector storage
- **API**: `POST /businesses/{id}/documents` with `documents` field

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 🔹 PDF Upload with Progress
- Drag & drop interface
- Real-time upload progress
- File validation (size, type)
- Error handling with user feedback

### 🔹 Business Context Integration  
- No localStorage dependency
- Real-time API synchronization
- Auto-save with debouncing

### 🔹 API Alignment

## 🚀 Next Steps (If Needed)
1. Update Firebase configuration with actual values from Firebase Console
2. Test file upload functionality end-to-end
3. Verify JWT token payload in browser developer tools
4. Test business context auto-save functionality

## 📝 Notes
- Backend PDF limit changed from 10MB → 3MB ✅ (Already done in backend)
- Backend file limit changed from 10 files → 1 file ✅ (Already done in backend)
