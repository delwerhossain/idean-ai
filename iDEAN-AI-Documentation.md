## Tab 1: Strategic Plan

### üéØ Problem Statement & Market Opportunity

#### Target Market Pain Points:
1. **Knowledge Deficit**: Not great at strategy making and planning
2. **Resource Constraints**: Lack time and money for traditional consulting
3. **Structural Approach**: Need proven frameworks, not guesswork
4. **Daily Operations**: Require ongoing strategic support, not one-time planning

### üöÄ Product Vision

**Category**: Intelligent Business Strategy AI  
**Positioning**: Daily AI-powered strategy + execution co-pilot  
**Differentiation**: Hybrid of consulting frameworks + AI execution engine

#### Unique Value Proposition:
